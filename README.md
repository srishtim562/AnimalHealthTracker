# AnimalHealthTracker
This cloud based animal health tracker is built using the LPC-2148 and RaspberryPi microcontrollers. I have written the code for interfacing sensors such as heart beat sensor, blood pressure sensor, temperature sensor, PIR sensor, GPS module etc. The main code is written in embedded C. The code for integration with the ThingSpeak Cloud is written in Python. The ThingShow mobile app is used to view the sensor parameters on a smartphone. Due to the covid-19 pandemic, I was unable to procure the hardware components and the sensors required, so, currently, the Python code sends dummy data to the cloud. Once the sensors are available, sensor data can be sent to the cloud.
